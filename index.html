        Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily
        of highly mineralized chitin, and armed with a pair of chelae (claws).
        Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the
        Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4 m (13 ft). Several other
        groups of crustaceans with similar appearances such as king crabs and
        porcelain crabs are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to
        true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.

        Crabs often show marked sexual dimorphism. Males often have larger
        claws, a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crabs
        of the genus Uca (Ocypodidae). In fiddler crabs, males have one greatly
        enlarged claw used for communication, particularly for attracting a
        mate. Another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon (abdomen);
        in most male crabs, this is narrow and triangular in form, while females
        have a broader, rounded abdomen. This is because female crabs brood
        fertilised eggs on their pleopods.

        Crabs typically walk sideways (hence the term crabwise), because of the
        articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient.
        Some crabs walk forward or backward, including raninids, Libinia
        emarginata and Mictyris platycheles. Some crabs, like the Portunidae and
        Matutidae, are also capable of swimming, the Portunidae especially so as
        their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.<br />

        Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as
        communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be
        aggressive toward one another, and males often fight to gain access to
        females. On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are
        occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes. Fiddler crabs (genus
        Uca) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and
        mating, and to defend against intruders.<br />
        Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae, and taking any other
        food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and
        detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many
        crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest
        growth and greatest fitness. Some species are more specialised in their
        diets, based in plankton, clams or fish.<br />
        Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for
        their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for
        the female to release her eggs.
